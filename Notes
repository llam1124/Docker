Problems before the Docker-era
  - Compatibility issues of multiple services and versions of operating system.
  - Also compatibility between services and the libraries versions of dependencies
  - Long setup time of development environment
  - Different results from different environment
  
 How Docker fix this
  - Each component of the application has its own separate container with its OWN libraries and its OWN dependencies
  - Container:
    => An isolated environment that has their own processes, services, networking interfaces, and mounts under the same operating system kernel unlike virtual machines (VM)
  - Purpose is to CONTAINERIZE applications, SHIP them, and RUN them
